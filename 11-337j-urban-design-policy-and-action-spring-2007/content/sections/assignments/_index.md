In the Spring 2007 course, students were asked to write two papers. The first paper responded to the prompt of "One Problem: Five Tools," and the second responded to "Dissecting an Urban Design Program." These assignments are not available on MIT OpenCourseWare.

Instead, this section contains a different set of assignments, used in the 2005 and 2006 courses, with five short assignments and a final paper.

In addition, students were required to submit a writeup of the Boston Civic Design Commission meeting that they attended.
